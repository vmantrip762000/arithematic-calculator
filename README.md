# arithematic-calculator
This enhanced code provides a user-friendly, robust, and **object-oriented C++ arithmetic calculator** implementation.

Code Description

Functions:
getvalue1() - Gets the first floating-point value.
getvalue2() - Gets the second floating-point value.
getOp() - Decides the operation to be performed (+, -, *, /) and also terminates the program.

Variables:
a, b, c are 3 floating-point variables
op is 1 character variable for the operation

Achievements:
Built a user-friendly and simple-to-use arithmetic calculator.
Learned and implemented unique functions to accept user inputs, perform user-defined operations, and display output to the user.
Constructed meaningful logic-based loops to minimize lines of code and reduce repetitive calculations.
